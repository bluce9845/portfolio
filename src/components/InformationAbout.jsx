        <span className="name-abt fw-semibold">Hi, I&apos;m Rizki Fiananda</span>. As a student aspiring to become a full-stack developer, my journey in the programming world has been full of challenges and valuable lessons. One day, while
        exploring Laravel, I encountered a confusing bug. This bug felt like a small reminder that the world of programming is full of puzzles that demand patience. From that moment, I learned that big problems often stem from tiny details,
        like a missing semicolon or a mislocated file. On this journey, I&apos;ve realized that frameworks like Laravel, React, and Django are just tools. The real control lies in the hands of developers like us. Sometimes, I feel like
        I&apos;m lost in a &ldquo;forest of code,&ldquo; but it&apos;s in those moments that I find the strength to dive deeper and keep moving forward.
      </p>

      <p className="ct-abt-2 mt-5">
        One of the most memorable moments was when I worked with paginate(3) in my Laravel project. That simple function taught me the importance of structuring code efficiently and creating user-friendly applications. It motivated me to
        delve deeper into both backend and frontend development, with the hope of building applications that are not only functional but also intuitive for users. For me, the programming world is an endless journey. Every line of code I
        write is a small step toward my big dream of becoming a full-stack developer. And while the road is filled with challenges, I believe that every effort I make today will bring me closer to achieving my goals.
